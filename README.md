# Me as a Developer

Hi there! As a developer, I am always eager to learn more and enjoy experimenting with code, tackling challenging problems. Below is a project I brewed up during my freshman year at Göteborgs University. 

Now, fair warning: the code might resemble a tangled ball of yarn, but hey everyone has been there at the start of their coding careers right? 

Please do keep in mind that this code does not reflect my current coding standards in terms of structure and problem-solving. The reason I am showcasing this on GitHub is to demonstrate my growth as a developer, rather than showcasing a great piece of code. For a more recent project, please visit: [Voteringsportalen](https://github.com/LudwigJL/voteringsportalen).


## JobMarketExplorer

Welcome to JobMarketExplorer, an application designed to provide insights into the dynamic trends within the job marketplace, specifically focusing on work positions and technologies within the IT and tech industry. Developed as a small project at Göteborgs Universitet, this application is built using Python and leverages APIs to fetch real-time data from the publicly available resources at https://data.jobtechdev.se.

## Features:

- **Market Trends:** Explore the latest trends in job positions and emerging technologies within the IT and tech industry.

- **Data Source:** The application retrieves data from the comprehensive and up-to-date public APIs provided by https://data.jobtechdev.se.

- **Python Powered:** Built using Python, ensuring a robust and versatile foundation for seamless functionality and future enhancements.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LudwigJL/jobmarketexplorer
   cd JobMarketExplorer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```

4. **Explore and Analyze:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start exploring the trends in the IT and tech job marketplace.

## Acknowledgments:

This marks the completion of a small project undertaken at the university. The primary objectives were to be familiarized with utilizing open APIs to extract valuable insights within a specific domain. 
The code might have been updated at specific areas in order for the application to not be outdated. Nevertheless, this serves as our initial exploration and commitment to the project's core ideas.

Happy exploring!
