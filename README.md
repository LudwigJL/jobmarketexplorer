## Acknowledgments:

This marks the completion of a small project undertaken at the university. The primary objectives were to familiarize ourselves with utilizing open APIs to extract valuable insights within a specific domain. Please note that the code may not be properly structured, as time constraints did not allow for thorough refinement before the deadline. Nevertheless, this serves as our initial exploration and commitment to the project's core ideas.

Happy exploring!
